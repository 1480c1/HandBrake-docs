Selecting a preset
==================

*Presets, presets, presets.*

Selecting a `Preset` can go a long way toward ensuring your video works where you want it to. A `Preset` is a group of settings specifically tailored for the software or device you want your videos to play on.

## Built-in presets

HandBrake includes a number of built-in `Presets` for various devices and general use.

Once you've opened a `Source`, select the `Preset` that most closely describes the device you want your videos to work on. For instance, if you want to play your videos on an iPad, choose the `iPad Preset`.

If your device is not listed, or you wish to play your videos on a computer, choose the `Normal Preset` or `High Profile Preset`. The `Normal Preset` is fast and compatible across a wide range of softwares and devices. The `High Profile Preset` makes better quality videos that take up less space, leaving room for a second audio track in surround sound.

## Custom presets

If you've previously saved one of your own `Presets`, you may select it in the same way as the built-in `Presets`. Learn more about Custom presets (TODO: link).
