Selecting a preset
==================

A `Preset` is a group of settings specifically tailored for the software or device you want your videos to play on. Selecting a `Preset` can go a long way toward ensuring your video works where you want it to.

## Official presets

HandBrake includes a number of official `Presets` for specific devices and for general use.

Once you've opened a `Source`, select the `Preset` that most closely describes the device you want your videos to work on. For instance, if you want to play your videos on a Roku that supports 1080p High Definition, choose the `Roku 1080p30 Surround` preset under `Devices`.

<!-- .system-win -->

<!-- TODO: Windows figures. -->

If your device is not listed, or you wish to play your videos on a computer, the default `Fast 1080p30` preset is a good choice. It's fast and compatible across a wide range of software and devices.

## Custom presets

If you've previously saved one of your own `Presets`, you may select it in the same way as the official `Presets`. Learn more about [Custom presets](../advanced/custom-presets.html).
