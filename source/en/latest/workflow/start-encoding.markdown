Starting encoding
=================

Now that you've got all your settings just right, it's time to make your new video!

## Selecting a destination

`Destination` is where your new video will go. You can select the `Browse...` button to choose a new location and name, or type it directly in the box.

Please take special care to *note your destination*. Otherwise, you won't be able to find your new video. You can move it later if you desire.

## Starting the encode

Select the `Start` button on the toolbar to make your new video.

HandBrake will report its progress while it's working and alert you when it's finished. Then you will have a new video file at the `Destination` you specified.

Congratulations! You just encoded your first video using HandBrake. It's now ready to watch on your devices.
