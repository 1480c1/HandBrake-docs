Starting encoding
=================

Now that you've got all your settings just right, it's time to make your new video!

## Selecting a destination

`Destination` is where your new video will go. You can select the `Browse...` button to choose a new location and name, or type it directly in the box.

<!-- .system-lin -->

<!-- TODO: Linux figures. -->

<!-- /.system-lin -->
<!-- .system-mac -->

![Selecting a destination](../images/mac/destination.png)

<!-- /.system-mac -->
<!-- .system-win -->

<!-- TODO: Windows figures. -->

<!-- /.system-win -->

Please take special care to *note your destination*. Otherwise, you won't be able to find your new video. You can move it later if you desire.

## Starting the encode

Select the `Start` button on the toolbar to make your new video.

<!-- .system-lin -->

<!-- TODO: Linux figures. -->

<!-- /.system-lin -->
<!-- .system-mac -->

![Main window toolbar](../images/mac/toolbar.png "The Toolbar provides easy access to HandBrake's most common functions.")

![Starting an encode](../images/mac/start-button.png "The Start button begins encoding.")

<!-- /.system-mac -->

HandBrake will report its progress while it's working and alert you when it's finished. Then you will have a new video file at the `Destination` you specified.


<!-- .system-mac -->

![Encode progress](../images/mac/encode-progress.png "HandBrake reports its progress during encoding.")

![Encoding complete alert](../images/mac/encode-complete.png "HandBrake shows an alert when finished encoding.")

<!-- /.system-mac -->


Congratulations! You just encoded your first video using HandBrake. It's now ready to watch on your devices.

<!-- .continue -->

## Next steps

If you didn't get a video file as expected, encountered an error, or had some other trouble, you can continue reading to learn more about how HandBrake works or jump right to [Troubleshooting common issues](../help/troubleshooting-common-issues.html).
