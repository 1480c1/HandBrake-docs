Previewing your settings
========================

Video encoding requires a lot of computer resources and can take awhile to complete. Exactly how long depends on a number of factors, including the duration, resolution, and complexity of your `Source`, and the settings for making your new video.

Luckily, HandBrake has a `Preview` feature that allows you to do a test run on a few seconds or minutes of your `Source`, so you can see what your new video will look like without waiting for a complete encode to finish.

## Opening the Preview window

At the top of HandBrake's main window, you'll see a toolbar with various buttons.

Select the `Preview` button to open the `Preview` window.

## Adjusting Preview settings

Move your mouse cursor over the `Preview` window, and some controls will appear.

Set the starting position by dragging the `Position` control left or right. Choose how many seconds of video you want to encode using the `Duration` control. Longer durations will take more time to encode.

## Starting a Preview encode

When you're satisfied with your starting position and duration, select `Live Preview` and be patient. HandBrake will report its progress while it works. When your `Preview` is ready, it will play automatically. You can use the playback controls to pause, rewind, and replay your `Preview`.

## Finishing up

To create a new `Preview`, select the `Still Previews` button to start over. When you're finished previewing your work, you may close the `Preview` window.

## Next steps

If the `Preview` you created was lacking in quality or otherwise not as expected, you may need to [adjust quality](adjust-quality.html) or select a different [Preset](select-preset.html), after which you can create another `Preview` to see any changes.

Once you are satisfied, continue to [Starting encoding](start-encoding.html).
