Quick start
===========

HandBrake takes videos you already have and makes new ones that work on your mobile phone, tablet, TV media player, game console, computer, or web browserâ€”nearly anything that supports modern video formats.

This quick start guide assumes you have already downloaded and installed HandBrake. If you do not already have HandBrake, please see [Downloading and installing HandBrake](../get-handbrake/download-and-install.html).

Let's get started.

## Launch HandBrake

Launch HandBrake by quickly clicking twice (double-clicking) on the cocktail & pineapple icon.

## Open your existing video

HandBrake calls the video you already have the `Source`.

Select the `Open Source` button on the toolbar to browse your files for a video to open. You may also drag your `Source` video onto HandBrake's main window.

## Select a title

Some `Sources` may contain more than one video clip, or a collection of `Titles`. Use HandBrake's `Title` control to select which video clip you want to use. Many `Sources` have only one `Title`, while Blu-ray and DVD sources often have multiple `Titles`.

## Select a preset

HandBrake provides a number of settings `Presets` to make your new video work well with your playback devices and software. For instance, if you have a third generation Apple TV, you may wish to select the `AppleTV 3` preset. The default `Normal` preset is fast and relatively compatible.

`Presets` can affect compatibility (whether your video will work with your devices and software) and encoding time. Learn more: [Selecting a preset](../workflow/select-preset.html)

## Select a destination

`Destination` is where your new video will go. You can select the `Browse...` button to choose a new location and name, or type it directly in the box.

Please take special care to *note your destination*. Otherwise, you won't be able to find your new video. You can move it later if you desire.

## Start the encode

Select the `Start` button on the toolbar to make your new video.

![Starting an encode](../images/start-button.png)

HandBrake will report its progress while it's working and alert you when it's finished. Then you will have a new video file at the `Destination` you specified.

Congratulations! You just encoded your first video using HandBrake. It's now ready to watch on your devices.
